   - Define a tuple and provide a simple example.

2. **How do you create a tuple in F#?**
   - Show the syntax for creating a tuple with multiple elements.

3. **How do you access elements of a tuple?**
   - Explain how to retrieve specific elements using indexing.

4. **Can tuples contain different types?**
   - Provide an example demonstrating that tuples can hold mixed types.

5. **What is the maximum number of elements a tuple can have in F#?**
   - Discuss the limitations on tuple sizes.

### Intermediate Questions

6. **How do you pattern match on a tuple?**
   - Provide an example of using pattern matching to deconstruct a tuple.

7. **What is the difference between tuples and records in F#?**
   - Compare tuples and records regarding structure, mutability, and usage.

8. **Can you create a nested tuple?**
   - Give an example of a tuple containing another tuple.

9. **How do you return a tuple from a function?**
   - Write a function that returns a tuple and show how to call it.

12. **How can you use tuples with higher-order functions?**
    - Show an example of using tuples with functions like `map` or `fold`.

13. **How can you destructure a tuple in a function parameter?**
    - Provide an example that shows destructuring in the function definition.

14. **Can you use tuples in F# discriminated unions?**
    - Explain how tuples can be part of a discriminated union with an example.

15. **What are the implications of immutability when using tuples?**
    - Discuss how immutability affects tuple usage in F#.
